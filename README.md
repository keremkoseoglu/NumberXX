NumberXX
========

Did you watch the movie "The Number 23"? Good. This program has been written to prove a friend obsessed with the number "13" to prove that many numbers can be calculated using many phrases.

You simple enter a phrase, enter your target number; and the program attempts to "prove" that your phrase is somewhat connected to the number you entered. Just like seen in the movie "The Number 23".

It also demonstrates many string and number manipulation algorhytms.
