\f0\fs26 \cf2 \cb3 Project Description\
Did you watch the movie "The Number 23"? Good. This program has been written to prove a friend obsessed with the number "13" to prove that many numbers can be calculated using many phrases. \
\
You simple enter a phrase, enter your target number; and the program attempts to "prove" that your phrase is somewhat connected to the number you entered. Just like seen in the movie "The Number 23".\
\
It also demonstrates many string and number manipulation algorhytms. \
